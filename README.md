# Thesis-Bifurcation-control-via-shape-optimization-for-particle-separation-in-microfluidic-channels-
This repository contains the simulation code and scripts developed for my Master's thesis at Heidelberg University and the University of Oxford. The project investigates how bifurcations in particle equilibrium positions can be controlled through channel shape optimization, enabling size-based separation of particles in curved microfluidic ducts.
